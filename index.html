<p>Most of the time I forget what projects I have started. So, this page is just a reminder for the works I am involved in and NOTHING else.</p>

<p> Algebraic Geometry PDF - <a href="https://github.com/truthandbeauty/Algebraic-Geometry/blob/main/AlgebraicGeometry%20-%20Main.pdf"> <font color="blue"> agelrbaic geometry pdf </font> </a>. </p>

<h3> [1] Books </h3>
<p>Link to the local folder - <a href="file:///C:\Users\ravik\Documents\[1]Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)"> <font color="blue"> Books </font></a>. </p>
This page is dedicated to all my readings of mathematical books. I am trying to maintain Latex Notes to whatever extent possible. I have no intention to latex all the result of the books (that is the reason why I use handwritten notes - to avoid Latexing) but to whatever extent I feel (or need), I latex them.

<h3> [2] Research and Exposition </h3>
<p>Link to the local folder - <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)\[2] Pure Mathematics - Research and Exposition"> <font color="blue"> Research and Exposition </font> </a>. </p>
Here, I include the following work : 
<ul>
<li> Expository works - detailed exposition </li>
<li> Historical Developments - detail work, only histroical developments in one big area and not for few problems </li>
<li> Research Paper Readings - detailed notes of any research papers that I read </li>
<li> Mathematical readings - articles of non-technical nature which is intended to give you the gist and motivation for the subject rather than the techniques </li>
<li> Ideas - research ideas or directions that might seed in your mind </li>
<li> Publication - My attempt to publish any paper.</li> 
</ul>

<h3> [3] Outside Pure Mathematics </h3>
<p>Link to the local folder - <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)\[3] Pure Mathematics - Outside Pure Mathematics"> <font color="blue"> Outside Pure Maths </font> </a>. </p>

The file includes content of non-technical nature but still related to mathematics for e.g. physchology, neurology, fun-problems (not advanced maths) etc.
<ul>
<li> Daily Musing in Mathematics - Lately, I am using it as source of rough. If I cannot find any other heading for the mathematics I do, I include it here. </li>
<li> General philosophy - How to do maths </li>
<li> Any tentative planning method comes to my mind. </li>
<li> Fun Problems and their solutions(not advanced math but under high schools). </li>
<li> My session with any professor. </li>
<li> On Mathematical writing. </li>
</ul>

<h2> [4] Goals and Progress (Most Important) </h2>
<p>Link to the local folder - <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)\[4] Pure Mathematics - Goals and Progress"> <font color="blue"> Goals and Progress </font> </a>. </p>

This is another interesting project which I started to keep myself motivated and on the track. I maintain:
<ul>
<li> Books List - list of the books that I read or want to read. </li>
<li> Reseach paper, Non-technical and Expository works list - Again, this is just a list of papers that I have read or want to read in the future. </li>
<li> <b>Goals - weekly (or 3-4) days progress update for what I have done - books reading, exercise solving, papers reading etc. everything </b></li>
<li> Completed Books/papers/exposition - Whatever I have done in the Goals section, update here so that after a month, I feel like achieving something. Small steps/successes that matters in mathematics. </li>
</ul>

<h3> [5] Research Statement  </h3>

<p>Link to the local folder -  <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)\[5] Pure Mathematics - Research Statement"> <font color="blue"> Research Statement </font> </a></p>

<h3> [6] Problems in Different Areas of Mathematics  </h3>

<p>Link to the local folder -  <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)\[6] Pure Mathematics - Problems in Different Areas of Mathematics"> <font color="blue"> Problems in Different Areas of Mathematics </font> </a></p>

The file includes my attempt to include all the famous problems in different areas of mathematics. It is mainly to give motivation for the subject.
I have not intention to include the complete solution of these problems since that will itself be included in their respective theory in Books or Research and
 exposition. But the intention is to present the problem in the context of the subject in which it arises. Probably, I wll just end up stating the problems and 
its intuition in the subject only. Not more than that.

<h3> [7] Yearwise Planning  </h3>

<p>Link to the local folder -  <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)\[7] Yearwise Plan- Pure Mathematics"> <font color="blue"> Yearwise Planning </font> </a></p>

My target for a particular year.

<h3> [8] Curriculul Vitae  </h3>

<p>Link to the local folder -  <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[0]Pure Maths Latexing (Every work)\[8] CV"> <font color="blue"> CV </font> </a></p>

<h3> [9] Common Bibliography File  </h3>

<p>Link to the local folder -  <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\Mathematics\[6]Common Bibliography File"> <font color="blue"> Common Bibliography File </font> </a></p>

This is a very important and understated file that needs special care. I started this file because I wanted to maintain just one list of all the references so that I can use if for all my mathematical writing purposes.
<hr>

<h3> [8] English  </h3>

<p>Link to the local folder -  <a href="file:///C:\Users\Ravi\Documents\English\English-Latex"> <font color="blue"> English </font> </a></p>

This file is mainly for improving my English, grammar, writing skills, anything related to English. The list includes:

<ul>
<li> Grammar. </li>
<li> My personal writings (not related to maths). </li>
<li> Habit - Attempt at forming habits. I maintain an <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yzWpGseQks7XvEpls0KZOLvg9vgPT5fek2s-J7uXX6Y/edit#gid=0"> <font color="blue"> excel sheet </font> </a>  for weekly progress. </li>
</ul>

There are some web sites that I should be actively involved in, from time to time (definitely not regular).
